### Russian Travel
**Russian Travel** is an adaptive and responsive website that was made without using frameworks, in pure CSS, and available at any screen width. The website was built for educational purposes while studying at [Practicum by Yandex](https://praktikum.yandex.ru/).

It's the summer of 2020, and the coronavirus has changed lots of people's plans. Cancelled flights, closed railway stations, airports and borders. No one knows exactly when it all will end, but it will for sure, and we will be able to return to normal life, to travelling.

Russia is a whole universe with a gentle sea in the south, dense Sayan forests and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. You can see all these beauties without millions on your account, without a visa and many hours of flights and transfers.

Traveling in Russia is fascinating, and nature is surprisingly diverse.
